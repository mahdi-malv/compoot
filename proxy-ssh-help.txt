1. Generate new ssh identity/key. Accept the default location (under ~/.ssh directory):
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N ""

2. If you don't have direct access to the vm, start a proxy server with access
   to the target vm (this could be a docker container on the localhost running
   a vpn service)..

3. Assuming a proxy server with an established vpn connection is running, the 
   following information are needed for this example:
       - The proxy server accessible at $pxuser@$pxip:$pxport using ssh.
       - The target vm accessible at $vmuser@$vmip:$vmport through the proxy-
         -server and using ssh.
   Using the three afformentioned users, ips, and ports, we can issue the
   following command to add our host to the target vm ssh:
    ssh-copy-id -f -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p $pxuser@$pxip -p $pxport" -o Port=$vmport $vmuser@$vmip

   example:
    ssh-copy-id -o ProxyCommand='ssh -W %h:%p root@localhost -p 2223' -o Port=7777 saeed@192.168.119.117

4. From now on, we just need to use the proxy server as a jump proxy to access
   the target vm:
    ssh -o ProxyCommand='ssh -W %h:%p $pxuser@$pxip -p $pxport' $vmuser@$vmip -p $vmport
   Or:
    ssh -J $pxuser@$pxip:$pxport $vmuser@$vmip -p $vmport

   example:
    ssh -o ProxyCommand='ssh -W %h:%p root@localhost -p 2223' saeed@192.168.119.117 -p 7777
    ssh -J root@localhost:2223 saeed@192.168.119.117 -p 7777

    Note: You can tell ssh to always use a particular proxy server as a jump proxy for
          a specific host. This needs to be done once in the ssh config file and you
          will no longer have to type in all those extra arguments in ssh command.
          Search for "ssh jumpproxy config".
